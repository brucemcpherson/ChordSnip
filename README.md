you can see [library and dependency information here](dependencies.md)

The Chord Snip Add-on documentation is here. https://ramblings.mcpher.com/apps-script/add-ons/chord-snip/

You can pretty much do what you will with this source code (see https://ramblings.mcpher.com/reusing-code-from-this-site/ for more info) - but this Sheets Add-on already exists, so don't just create another the same.
